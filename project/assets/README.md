# About `assets` directory

A convenient place to put utility files that need to be accessed directly by the browser.

The directory is supposed to contain the web-assets (JS, CSS, Fonts, Images, User-uploaded files etc.) which need to be fetched by the web browser. Each of these items are to be placed in their corresponding directories. 

**NOTE**: If you have a JS library which comes with its own set of HTML/CSS/JS files, then put it in the `js` directory.
