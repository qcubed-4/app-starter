# About `project` directory

When you initialize your project for the first time with [app-starter](https://github.com/qcubed-4/app-starter), this folder is placed at the root of your project home. Almost all the work that you do with the application moving forward will be done inside this directory. It hosts:

  1. `assets`: Your JS, CSS, Images, Fonts etc. which make your application look and behave well on the front-end (client's browser).
  2. `forms`: This folder will have the generated forms which you can use for manual CRUD operations on your application's database(s).
  3. `generated`: This folder will have the files generated by the code generator (other than the forms). These include the base classes for ORM (the data model handlers), form bases, and connector base. You can read more about them in the README files located in those directories. 
  4. `includes`: This directory contains most of the logic your project is going to use. If you need to alter any class from the core (framework, code generator, connector, panels etc.), then you can override that class in this directory. It also contain the `app_includes` directory where most of your application logic is supposed to reside. 
  5. `tmp`: This directory is supposed to hold temporary files which can be deleted later on. It will usually contain caches and form states.
